You can fork it on the top right, do your magic and let us know where we can find your work before your next interview. Don't worry about icons, fonts and styling beyond positioning. That's out of scope."

These geometries are generated daily by our satellite processing engine and are called "detections".  Detections are further grouped into events that describe atomic deforestation efforts. We have thousands of events of which we included a few in events.json attached to this REPL.'
